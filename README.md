# Academic job application templates

<!-- TODO: add link -->
[See this blog post](#) 

## Contents

- `cv.tex`: template for a curriculum vitae.
  Slightly modified from clean_cv from here.
- `references.bib`: BibTeX file with manuscripts, papers, and posters.
  Mostly, this is exported from my Paperpile library.
- `research.tex`: template for a statement of research.
  I built it (and the following) from scratch with a lot of help
  from [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com/learn)
  and [stack exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com).
- `teaching.tex`: template for a teaching statement
- `dei.tex`: template for a diversity, inclusion, and equity statement.
- PDFs for the above. The PDFs here are generated by compiling the LaTeX documents

## Branches

There are different branches for different versions of each document,
which you can access with `git checkout`:

- `main`: Contains the documents with highlighted placeholders for
  things to personalize for individual applications
- `ue-mcb`: Application for the University of Examples,
  Department of Molecular and Cell Biology
- `umass-ex`: Application for the University of Massachusetts, Example.
