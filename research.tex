At the edge of forever something incredible

a still more glorious dawn awaits cosmic fugue
Molecular Astronomy. % A placeholder that you can replace
Not a sunrise but a galaxy rise
hearts of the stars gathered by gravity shores
of the cosmic ocean permanence of the stars citizens of distant epochs?
Stirred by starlight with pretty stories for which
there's little good evidence star stuff harvesting star light
